<h1>Hello! I'm Funie!</h1>
<p>Thanks for looking a bit in my page.</p>
<p>I'm still a beginner in programming - so I don't have so much contributions nor repos. I promise I'll eventually learn and contribute to any repository out. One day.</p>
<p>Linux holds a special place in my heart. I use it and I don't plan on leaving it, thanks Debian for welcoming me back to Linux and thanks KDE for making such a beautiful Desktop Environment I can use with stability.</p>
